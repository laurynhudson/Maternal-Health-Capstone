## Maternal Health Risk Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the maternal health risk level (high risk, mid risk, or low risk) using machine learning models. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help healthcare providers identify high-risk pregnancies early, enabling timely interventions to improve maternal outcomes.

### Dataset Description
Source: The dataset used in this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data/data.
Size: The dataset contains the following features:
Age: Age of the mother.
SystolicBP: Systolic blood pressure.
DiastolicBP: Diastolic blood pressure.
BS: Blood sugar levels.
BodyTemp: Body temperature.
HeartRate: Heart rate.
RiskLevel: The target variable, indicating the risk level (high, mid, or low risk).
